# OEPapi
Open Education Platform API

The goal of the project is to provide a platform for constant improvements in how to educate people.
Creating a structure around the massive and endless journey on improving the transfer of knowledge and insights.

## Layers

The API is split into 5 layers, each layer is a container which hosts applications with a similar goal but with a different perspective. The end goal is to provide the best solution to achieve the best individual learning experience.

### Knowledge Maps

Splitting knowledge in its smallest nodes and creating a relational web of dependencies.

### Knowledge Classes

Covering one or more Knowledge Map nodes. Learnable when all their dependencies have been fullfilled.

### Knowledge Tests

Covering one or more Knowledge Map nodes. Verify the grade of knowledge.

### Knowledge State

Storing an individual person's covered nodes. Every node has a multi state floating variable values to make sure knowledge is repeatedly verified. Additional to neutral states, personal states are stored to achieve an overview of which type of classes achieves the most optimal learning experience for this individual.

### Knowledge Benchmarks

Innovative ways to find out which Maps, Classes, Tests and Knowledge State layers have the most optimal learning experience.
